# [React](https://reactjs.org/) ·

React is a JavaScriptlibrary for buildinguser interfaces.

* **Declarative**: React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.
* **Component-Based**: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.
* **Learn Once, Write Anywhere**: We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.

## Installation


## Examples
We have several examples [on the website](https://reactjs.org/). Here is the first one to get you started:
``` js
function HelloMessage({ name }) {
  return <div>Hello {name}</div>;
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <HelloMessage name="Taylor" />,
  document.getElementById('container')
);
```
This example will render "Hello Taylor" into a container on the page.

You'll notice that we used an HTML-like syntax; we call it JSX. JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and writing it feels like writing HTML. If you're using React as a `<script>` tag, read this section on integrating JSX; otherwise, the [recommended JavaScript toolchains](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) handle it automatically.
